# Hi, I'm Rudraksh 👋

🌱 I'm currently learning Python through the 100 Days of Code challenge.  
💻 Linux enthusiast – love working in the terminal and exploring open-source tools.  
🎯 My goal is to build a strong foundation in programming, problem-solving, and eventually dive into **AI/ML**.  
⚡ Fun fact: I started my tech journey experimenting with Linux at 12–13 years old.
